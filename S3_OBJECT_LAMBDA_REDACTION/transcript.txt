*Call center Agent :*

Thank you for calling customer support. I am Zhang Wei. How can I assist you today ?

*Customer :*

Hello Zhang Wei. My name is Victor Baze. My credit card number 4147-0000-1111-5555 has a minimum payment of $24.53 that is due by July 31st. Based on my autopay settings, that amount should have withdrawn on the due date from my bank account 5543225486 with the routing number 123459832. But that hasn’t happened and now I might have to pay a late fee, this is frustrating

*Customer Agent :*

Thank you. I have verified your information and I find that there was error in processing your payment from your Bank and I have gone ahead and corrected the problem. Rest assured, you won’t be charged the late fee.

Also you will receive a confirmation of the payment as text message on your phone number. The number that I have on file is 206-555-0100 (tel:2065550100). Is that the correct number ?
